Design Principle Analysis:
1. Discoverability/Signifiers - Are users able to easily find the points of the application that they are interested in?
Yes.  The buttons used to set the metric for the word cloud are easily distinguishable as buttons.  The word cloud is immediately visible upon visiting the page.  
2. Learnability - Are users able to easily learn and remember how to interact with your application?
	Yes.  The page is simple enough such that any user will understand its function.  The buttons are obviously manipulatable. 
3. Feedback - Is there strong evidence of user feedback for actionable items?
	 Yes.  Selecting a criterion immediately alters the word cloud.
4. Natural Mapping/Mental Metaphors - Is there strong evidence of providing natural mappings or relatable metaphors that help the user navigate the application?
	Yes.  Buttons will be familiar to anyone who has browsed the web in the past.
5. Constraints - Does the application have deliberate constraints to guide the flow of user interaction?
	Yes.  The selection of criteria are deliberately limited to those relevant to the interests of a real estate agent looking for the most profitable area to operate in.
6. Error Prevention/Recovery - Is there strong evidence of error prevention and error recovery so that the user won’t be left confused when something unexpected happens?
	The application is simple enough so that there is little in the way of error prevention or recovery.

Team Contribution:
The entire team worked on part 1 to understand the technical aspect and all decided to choose our site to be dedicated to real estate agents. 

Adam and Allan both worked on writing up the READme. Adam was also the person who suggested to create a word cloud design with the data information we were using. Since most of these technology were fairly new to us, we kept it simple and just used what we learned from lab for our application. Kaitlin quickly sketched out the basic design layout for the application and begun implementation of the skeleton. Chris and Kirk were more focused towards getting the data parsed correctly onto the webpage. Chris got the method working and also adjusted minor css aspects. Overall since the technological side of this assignment was fairly new to us. We all gather together to work on the project.
